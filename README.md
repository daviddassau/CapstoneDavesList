# Dave's List

**Dave's List** is a directory that allows site visitors to discover online retailers that specialize in products that are responsibly made.

### What do you mean by "Responsibly Made"?
When we say that these retailers offer products that are made responsibly, we mean that they could meet any of the following criteria:
- Made from 100% recycled material
- Made from locally sourced material
- Beauty items that are cruelty-free
- Food/Grocery items that are organic, and truly made from the best stuff on Earth.

### What to expect from the app
The app serves as a directory that users can utilize to find both online and brick-and-mortar companies that specialize in products that are made from 100% recycled material, locally sourced, hand-made, cruelty-free, etc. The information that their search results will give them will be:
- Retailer's name
- Retailer's location (if it's online only, where they're based out of)
- Retailer's website
- A short description of what the company does, and the kinds of products they offer.
