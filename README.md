# Dave's List

Dave's List is my final capstone project for the back-end of Nashville Software School.

The app is an API that users can utilize to find both online and brick-and-mortar companies that specialize in products that are made from 100% recycled material, locally sourced, hand-made, cruelty-free, etc. The information that their search results will give them will be:
1. Retailer's name
2. Retailer's location (if it's online only, where they're based out of)
3. Retailer's website
4. A short description of what the company does, and the kinds of products they offer.
